# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Getting started

Check out the following links to get started if you're interested in making code contributions
to this project:

- Set up a [development](development.md) environment
- Run the [regression tests](regression-tests.md)
- Run the [load tests](load-tests.md)

Every contribution for bug fixes and new features should include unit tests and documentation to
benefit other developers and facilitate the long-term maintenance of this project.

Whenever possible, keep each pull request focused on a specific code change. Avoid mixing multiple
bug fixes or new features in the same pull request. This will make it easier for the project
maintainers to review your individual pull requests. This will also allow merging the reviewed
PRs faster and not block them if other code changes need extra review time.

Also, it is preferrable to create pull requests based on the official master branch.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.
